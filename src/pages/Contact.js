              <Accordion.Body>
                Our small group adventures (maximum 6 people) have become incredibly popular! With Luke personally guiding every trip and our commitment to quality over quantity, we can only run a limited number of adventures each year. The combination of word-of-mouth recommendations and returning groups has filled our calendar through 2026.

                Cancellations do happen occasionally. When they do, we immediately notify our waitlist members in order of registration. If you're flexible with dates and have a group of 4+ ready to go, you have the best chance of securing a cancelled spot.

              <Accordion.Body>
                We monitor weather constantly and will postpone if conditions are dangerous (extreme heat, bushfire risk, severe storms). Light rain or cool weather doesn't stop us - that's what good gear is for! Some of our best adventures have been in moody weather.

              <Accordion.Body>
                Meeting points vary by location. Typically, we meet at a landmark in Melbourne for carpooling, or directly at the trailhead if you're driving yourself. Full details including GPS coordinates are provided a week before your trip.
